# Kindle

This method explains how to obtain free pdf's of books which are available as kindle editions on amazon. This method is relatively complex and long but considering you could get 90% of your books for free --potentially saving you 1000+$--, it is definitely worth learning. 

Required:

1)A computer/laptop with Windows/MacOS

2)Kindle 1.17 for Mac or Kindle 1.17 for Windows. Download your version [here](https://mega.nz/#F!I3glDIJQ!MAhFKZFtyyTLeGKbCDK7cg). If you already have a kindle app, delete it and download the 1.17 version specificially. 

3)An amazon account. 

---------------------------------------------------------
The basic idea of this method is that you take advantage of amazon's 7 day no-questions-asked refund for kindle ebooks. You'll buy a ebook, You'll download the ebook to your kindle app on your computer and then you'll convert it into a pdf file. Then you'll get your full refund. 

Let's get started. In this tutorial I'll show you how to get the ebook "Understanding Rhetoric 2nd Edition" (English 1A) using this method. 

# Important : Once you download and install Kindle App disable "Automatic Updates"

You can do this in MacOS by going to Preferences>Updates>Uncheck

In Windows, go to the Tools menu, then Options, then General and uncheck the box to install updates automatically (Not a windows user so someone should confirm this)

Once done with downloading. You should try to locate where the kindle file has download on your computer. 

To find the location go to preference and you should find something like this.

If you can't seem to find that folder just change the folder location to desktop or other location. It should copy the ebooks. 

You should find a .azw/.azw1/.azw3/.azw4 file. Copy that file and paste it in a different folder.

Now before you figure out how to convert it to pdf, I highly recommend you start the refund process. Go to your amazon account>Your content and devices

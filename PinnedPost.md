### Welcome to SJSU-PDF Sharing group. READ THIS before posting. 

RULES:
1) If you are here to share a ebook you found, Just make a post with the book's title, author and attach the file. 
2) If you are looking for a book,

* FIRST
>Use the search function of the group and see if anyone else has requested/shared the book. 

* SECOND
>If you don't find it in the group, go to this link (http://bit.do/sjsupdf) and check if the file exists in the folder. 

* THIRD
>If you don't find it there, go to library genisis (http://gen.lib.rus.ec/ OR http://libgen.io OR http://93.174.95.27/). Search for the textbook and download it. It should in all likelihood have the textbook you're looking for (if there exists a electronic copy that is)

* FOURTH
>If you don't find it there, go to this (http://bit.do/sjsulinks) page to find other websites which provide ebooks. Just run a quick search at each website. 

* FIFTH
>Look if there's a kindle edition of the book you're looking for on amazon. If there is, look at this guide (http://bit.do/kindlepdf) to learn a way to get your hands on it for free. (leave a comment on this post if you are having trouble in this method, admins/mods will help you out)

* SIXTH
>If the world has failed you so far, just make a post here including the tag [request] in the beginning. Include book name, author, edition, isbn number etc. Comment down below too.

#### Why are you guys doing this?
> TL;DR: Books are just too freakin EXPENSIVE!!!
 
> Eh. It just started out of boredom and at the same time, the unwillingness
to pay for overpriced books. Generally, a book would need to have it's
contents changed over 20% in order to have a new edition released. Nowadays,
if writers (or authors) don't make "new content" for their books, the
publishers threaten to not pay the author royalties and such. As a result,
many writers will just switch some chapters around and renumber some
questions here and there. So in the end, textbooks is just another way for
companies to get money out of students... Which is NOT fine with me.

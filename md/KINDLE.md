# Kindle

This method explains how to obtain free pdf's of books which are available as kindle editions on Amazon. This method is relatively complex and long but considering you could get 90% of your books for free --potentially saving you $1000+-- , it is definitely worth learning. 

Required:

1. A computer/laptop with Windows/MacOS

2. Kindle 1.17 for Mac or Kindle 1.17 for Windows. Download your version [here](https://mega.nz/#F!I3glDIJQ!MAhFKZFtyyTLeGKbCDK7cg). If you already have a kindle app, delete it and download the 1.17 version specificially. 

3. An Amazon account. 

---------------------------------------------------------
The basic idea of this method is that you take advantage of Amazon's 7 day no-questions-asked refund for kindle ebooks. You'll buy a ebook, You'll download the ebook to your kindle app on your computer and then you'll convert it into a pdf file. Then you'll get your full refund. 

Let's get started. In this tutorial I'll show you how to get the ebook "Understanding Rhetoric 2nd Edition" (English 1A) using this method. 

# Important : Once you download and install Kindle App disable "Automatic Updates"

You can do this in MacOS by going to Preferences > Updates > Uncheck

In Windows, go to the Tools > Options , and uncheck the box to install updates automatically.

# Getting the kindle book 

Head over to Amazon,

Make sure your device shows under "Deliver to". Click on "Buy now with 1 click". [^1]

[^1]: Be sure to click "Buy" and not "Rent", otherwise you will not be able to remove the DRM protection on the your downloaded file!

It should show up instantly here and should start downloading. If it doesn't just right click and download.

Once the download finishes, locate where the kindle file on your computer. 

To find the location go to preference and you should find something like this. 

In Windows, it's located in `Documents\My Kindle Content`

If you can't find the folder, change the downloads folder in the kindle app to your desktop or another location. It should copy the ebooks over automatically. 

Within the folder, you should find a .azw/.azw1/.azw3/.azw4 file.

# Converting to pdf

You'll need two programs. 

### Calibre

Download [here](https://calibre-ebook.com/download)

### Ultimate-DRM-removal-tool

Download Windows Version [here](https://mega.nz/#!wnQWWBBC!ho2E8LRw-G5866rVZj15xv4So26GL9r1FL9mBrlI6oE)

Download MacOS Version [here](https://mega.nz/#!9uQShJrR!mkQYCpmWMTTaydXReh0OY8dE8VWkKQ5kSHBNwm9oK18)

(this tool says it has a 30 day trial period, but can just remove and reinstall it)

------------------------------------------------

Now there are many ways to convert to pdf, I'll be using the most reliable and secure way to do it . 

Launch Ultimate-DRM-removal-tool, drag the .azw file and hit convert now. After it's done converting (which less than a minute), click on open on the left of convert now. You'll find the .azw3 file.

Now launch calibre and drag the .azw3 file into the app.

Click on the book and click on "convert books>convert individually" on the top left.

Choose pdf(or any other format you prefer) on the corner right. The conversion process should start. Once done, right click on the book>open containing folder. There should be a pdf file of the book. 

# Getting a refund 

Go to your amazon account>Your content and devices

Click on return for refund and you'll have your money back in 3-10 days (It happens instantly most of the time).

--------------------------------------------------

This is a lenghty process, I'm working on a script which would automate the whole thing. Will update this guide once done. 

#### Do consider emailing the book you converted to pdf at 1i9@protonmail.com so we can add it to the mega ebooks folder [here](https://mega.nz/#F!w4ZgxCKb!5EZCVZIi-1p2X7a4YeadDA).
